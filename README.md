# StreamlinedMarkingTool
This project is looking to streamline the marking process by using Python on Linux. A command-line tool will be introduced, where the marker can view the student’s files, run the code, view the output. Unit tests will be supported and can be accessed from a configurable location. As a result, a CSV file will be produced listing the student’s marks, and other related information.
